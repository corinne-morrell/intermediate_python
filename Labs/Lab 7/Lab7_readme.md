## How to Run
-----
To run this program from the terminal, enter `python Lab7.py -d dna_filename -g gene_filename`, where `dna_filename` and `gene_filename` are the names of the `.txt` files containg the DNA strand and target gene, respectively, that you would like to test.

## Inputs
-----
The program requires command line arguments of `-d dna_filename` and `-g gene_filename`. If no file names are supplied in the command line, the user will receive a `no such file or directory` message.

## Outputs
-----
The program prints the DNA strand and target gene selected by the user in the command line. Then, it prints the best match to the target gene that exists within the DNA strand, as well as the similarity to the target gene, location of the best match within the strand, and any mutations present.
