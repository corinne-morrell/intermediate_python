cheetah max speed reduced by half, does not catch prey
cheetah initial acc reduced by half, does not catch prey
exhaustion rate doubled, still catches prey because all other factors constant the cheetah catches prey before exhaustion begins to affect its velocity
when max speed is increase by 50 %, cheetah does not catch prey any sooner (both occur around 37 m)
when acc is increased by 50%, cheetah catches prey nearly 10m sooner

acceleration is the key factor
did not run additional exhaustion trials because already proved this is least important factor for cheetah
